# dbt_ad_reporting v1.1.0

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨:
[PR #66](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/66) includes the following breaking changes:
- Dispatch update for dbt-utils to dbt-core cross-db macros migration. Specifically `{{ dbt_utils.<macro> }}` have been updated to `{{ dbt.<macro> }}` for the below macros:
    - `any_value`
    - `bool_or`
    - `cast_bool_to_text`
    - `concat`
    - `date_trunc`
    - `dateadd`
    - `datediff`
    - `escape_single_quotes`
    - `except`
    - `hash`
    - `intersect`
    - `last_day`
    - `length`
    - `listagg`
    - `position`
    - `replace`
    - `right`
    - `safe_cast`
    - `split_part`
    - `string_literal`
    - `type_bigint`
    - `type_float`
    - `type_int`
    - `type_numeric`
    - `type_string`
    - `type_timestamp`
    - `array_append`
    - `array_concat`
    - `array_construct`
- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- `dbt_utils.surrogate_key` has also been updated to `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key`. Since the method for creating surrogate keys differ, we suggest all users do a `full-refresh` for the most accurate data. For more information, please refer to dbt-utils [release notes](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/releases) for this update.
- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.
- Metric attirbutes have been renamed to be consistent with the latest version of dbt-metrics: `sql` -> `expression` and `type` -> `calculation_method`

## 🎉 Features 🎉
- Added ability for a user to allow records having nulls in url fields to be included in the `ad_reporting__url_report` and the underlying `*url_report` models. This is done by setting the below variable to `False` in your `dbt_project.yml` file. ([#72](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/72))

```yml
vars:
  ad_reporting__url_report__using_null_filter: False # Use this variable to include null urls for ALL upstream ad platform packages enabled in your project. Default is True. 
```
- Updated README with this information. ([#72](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/72))

## 🚘 Under the Hood 🚘
- Disabled the `not_null` test for `ad_reporting__url_report` when null urls are allowed. ([#72](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/72))
- Updated this package's `integration_tests/seeds/microsoft_ads_campaign_performance_daily_report_data` in light of [PR #23](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads_source/pull/23) on `dbt_microsoft_ads_source`.([#68](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/68))

# dbt_ad_reporting v1.0.4
## Feature Enhancement
- The `keyword_id` field (which is a surrogate key generated from the combination of 'account_id', 'line_item_id', 'segment', and 'placement' fields within the Twitter Ads source) has been added to the `ad_reporting__keyword_report` model for the Twitter Ads platform. ([#71](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/71))

## Bugfixes
- The `not_null` test on the `ad_reporting__keyword_report` has been adjusted to be tested on the `keyword_id` as opposed to the `keyword_text`. This is needed as there may be times where keyword historical records may be removed and lose reference in an upstream join. As such, the text may be lost and the null test should be applied to the ID instead. ([#71](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/71))

## 🎉 Feature Enhancements 🎉 
[PR #57](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/57) incorporates the following change:
- The package now includes a set of pre-defined [metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics) related to clicks, impressions, and spend (definitions [here](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/blob/main/models/ad_reporting_metrics.yml)). 
  - Refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting#optional-step-8-use-predefined-metrics) for the included metrics and instructions on how to use them.
  - Note: This requires you to manually add a dependency on the [dbt metrics package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt_metrics) to use.

## Fixes
[PR #60](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/60) incorporates the following change:
- The LinkedIn Ads schema and database variables were incorrectly documented within the README. The README has been updated to reflect the correct variable names. 
  - `linkedin_schema` has been properly updated to reflect `linkedin_ads_schema`
  - `linkedin_database` has been updated to reflect `linkedin_ads_database`.

# dbt_ad_reporting v1.0.0
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
[PR #54](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/54) incorporates these breaking changes:
- The previous `ad_reporting` model has been renamed to `ad_reporting__url_report` and will only include records that have non-null url values for more information on specific filters please refer to each platform package's `url_report` model.

## 🎉 Feature Enhancements 🎉 
[PR #54](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/54) includes the following new features:
- Apple Search Ads has officially been released and added to Ad Reporting.
- In addition to the `ad_reporting__url_report` model update, we have added **five** new models:
  - `ad_reporting__account_report`
  - `ad_reporting__campaign_report`
  - `ad_reporting__ad_group_report`
  - `ad_reporting__ad_report`
  - `ad_reporting__keyword_search_report`
- This package now leverages `ad_reporting__<platform>_enabled` variables to enable/disable all upstream packages and respective models all in one place.
- New corresponding documentation and updated docs for new models.
- This package leverages several different macros in order to successfully build each model and features a `macros_docs.yml` within the `macros` directory that provides details for each macro.

# dbt_ad_reporting v0.8.0
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- The `api_source` variable for the Google Ads package is now defaulted to `google_ads` as opposed to `adwords`. The Adwords API has since been deprecated by Google and is now no longer the standard API for the Google Ads connector. Please ensure you are using a Google Ads API version of the Fivetran connector before upgrading this package. ([#53](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/53))
  - Please note, the `adwords` version of this package will be fully removed from the package in August of 2022. This means, models under `models/adwords_connector` will be removed in favor of `models/google_ads_connector` models.

## Updates
- The `ad_reporting` final model is now materialized in a schema `<target_schema>_ad_reporting` by default. This may be overwritten if desired. ([#53](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/53))
# dbt_ad_reporting v0.7.0
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- The Google Ads dependency has been updated to now reference the latest version of the `dbt_google_ads` package (v0.6.0). This version of the package incorporates new and modified tables within the `Google Ads API` version of the connector. For more information, refer to the relevant [dbt_google_ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads_source/releases/tag/v0.6.0) and [dbt_google_ads_source](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/releases/tag/v0.6.0) v0.6.0 release notes.

# dbt_ad_reporting v0.6.0
TikTok Ads has been added as a dependency and is enabled by default. Be sure to disable the models via the README if you do not have a TikTok Ads connector.

## Feature Additions
- Added the TikTok Ads package to be included in the final `ad_reporting` model. ([#36](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/36))

# dbt_ad_reporting v0.6.0-b1
🎉 dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility Pre Release 🎉 An official dbt v1.0.0 compatible version of the package will be released once existing feature/bug PRs are merged.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependencies to refer to the latest individual ad package versions. Additionally, the latest individual ad package versions have a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.
# dbt_ad_reporting v0.5.1
## Feature Additions
- Added the `account_name` and `account_id` to the `stg_snapchat_ads` model. This will allow for the relevant Snapchat Ads account information to flow downstream into the final `ad_reporting` model. ([#30](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/pull/30))

## Under the Hood
- Cast the `account_id` and `external_account_id` as strings within the `stg_google_ads` model.
