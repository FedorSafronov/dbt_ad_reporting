### Linkedin Roll Up
Linkedin's "campaign group" reporting is the equivalent to all other platforms' "campaign" reporting; similarly, Linkedin's "campaign" reporting is equivalent to all other platforms' "ad group" reporting. Therefore, the Ad Reporting campaign model and ad group model each reflect the proper roll up for Linkedin with respects to other platforms.
